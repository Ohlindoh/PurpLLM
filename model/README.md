# Model Configuration Directory

This directory holds custom model configurations or Dockerfiles.

Examples:

- **Ollama**: Include pointers or scripts to pull and configure Ollama models.
- **llama.cpp**: Add build instructions, model files, or a Dockerfile for llama.cpp.

Feel free to extend this directory with your custom model setup.
